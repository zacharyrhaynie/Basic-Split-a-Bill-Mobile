# Basic Split a Bill Mobile

This is my basic split a bill but built with React Native for mobile. You can find the other one [here.](https://github.com/zacharyrhaynie/Basic-Split-a-Bill) The code is a bit different as Native adds more and requires different syntax than React. It was a fun exercise in learning about Native, even making such a basic app.

Here is the [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@zacharyrhaynie/share-a-bill)

### Prerequisites

Pretty much only need Node. It runs on React, React-Native, and of course Node. It has most everything installed or in the .json

### Installing

Fork the repo and run

```
npm install
```

There are a few different ways of deploying this. You can simply run 
```
npm start
```
and then scan that using the app from [Expo.io](https://expo.io/)
